# Exceptions-JAVA

The work in this repository shows my foundational work with Exceptions, including how to ceate my own Exception classes and how to invoke them in the main. I also show my understanding of the try- catch structure. 

Test.java contains the main string for InvalidGradeException
TestClass.java contains the main string for the out of Milk exception.
